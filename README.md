# tmux-claude-session-manager

[![screenshot](./docs/screenshot.jpg)](https://youtu.be/NnTV6r4l5D0)

Run many [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) sessions across your
projects, each in its own tmux session — then **list them, see which are done
vs. still working, and jump to one** from a single popup.

If you launch Claude per-directory (one nested session per project), you quickly
end up with a dozen of them and no way to tell which are finished without opening
each one. This plugin gives you:

- 🔢 **A central picker** (`prefix` + `u`) listing every running Claude agent —
  several in one project, and any running loose in an ordinary pane.
- 🟢 **Live status** per agent — `working` / `waiting` / `idle` — read straight
  from `claude agents --json`, so you instantly see which need you. No setup.
- 👁️ **A live preview** of each agent's screen right in the picker.
- 🎯 **Smart jump** — selecting an agent switches your client to the window it
  was launched from, then resumes it in a popup over it.
- 🚀 **A launcher** (`prefix` + `y`) that opens/attaches a Claude session for the
  current directory.
- ❌ **Quick kill** (`ctrl-x`) of a finished agent from the picker.
- 🔔 **Bell forwarding** — a bell in a dedicated session highlights the window
  you launched it from, so you notice even without opening the picker
  ([one-time Claude Code setup](#making-claude-ring-the-bell)).

Status needs no configuration. Claude Code publishes each agent's own state and
the picker reads it — there are no hooks to install.

## Prerequisites

- **tmux ≥ 3.2** (for `display-popup`)
- **[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)** — the picker UI
- **[jq](https://jqlang.org/)** — parses `claude agents --json`
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** ≥ 2.1.139 — for the
  `claude agents` command (`claude --version` to check)
- bash; macOS or Linux

## Install (tpm)

Add to `~/.tmux.conf` (or `~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`):

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'craftzdog/tmux-claude-session-manager'
```

Then hit `prefix` + <kbd>I</kbd> to install.

> **Keybinding note:** by default the plugin binds `prefix` + `y` (launch) and
> `prefix` + `u` (list). If your config binds those elsewhere, either change the
> options below, or make sure the plugin loads **after** your own bindings (put
> `run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'` _after_ them) so the one you want wins.

### Manual install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/craftzdog/tmux-claude-session-manager ~/clone/path
```

Add to `~/.tmux.conf`, then reload (`prefix` + <kbd>r</kbd> or `tmux source ~/.tmux.conf`):

```tmux
run-shell ~/clone/path/claude_session_manager.tmux
```

## Usage

| Key            | Action                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prefix` + `y` | Launch (or re-attach to) a Claude session for the current directory, in a popup |
| `prefix` + `d` | Close the popup and go back to your window, Claude session keeps running        |
| `prefix` + `u` | Open the agent picker                                                           |

Inside the picker:

| Key                       | Action                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `enter`                   | Jump to the agent (see [How it works](#how-it-works)) |
| `ctrl-x`                  | Kill the highlighted agent                            |
| `↑` / `↓`, type to filter | fzf navigation                                        |

Agents needing your attention (`waiting`, `idle`) sort to the top.

Every running Claude gets its own row — the picker identifies each by its process,
not by its tmux session. So several agents in one project all show up separately,
as does a Claude you started by hand in an ordinary pane.

## Options

Set any of these before the plugin loads (defaults shown):

```tmux
set -g @claude_launch_key     'y'        # prefix key: launch/open for current dir
set -g @claude_list_key       'u'        # prefix key: open the picker
set -g @claude_command        'claude'   # command run in new sessions
set -g @claude_args           ''         # extra args appended to the command
set -g @claude_session_prefix 'claude-'  # tmux session name prefix
set -g @claude_popup_width     '90%'     # popup width
set -g @claude_popup_height    '90%'     # popup height
set -g @claude_fzf_options    ''         # extra options passed to the fzf picker
set -g @claude_forward_bell   'on'       # highlight the origin window on a bell
```

For example, to skip permission prompts in launched sessions:

```tmux
set -g @claude_args '--dangerously-skip-permissions'
```

### Making Claude ring the bell

![bell-forwarding](./docs/bell-forwarding.png)

Forwarding relays a bell; it cannot create one. Claude Code has to emit it, and
two settings decide that — they live in **different files**.

**How** it notifies — `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "preferredNotifChannel": "terminal_bell"
}
```

Only `terminal_bell` and `iterm2_with_bell` write a real `\a`. `iterm2`, `kitty`
and `ghostty` send escape sequences that tmux does not count as a bell,
`notifications_disabled` sends nothing, and the default `auto` picks by terminal —
so pin it.

**When** it notifies — `~/.claude.json`, the global config (`settings.json`
ignores this key and drops it silently):

```json
{
  "messageIdleNotifThresholdMs": 0
}
```

Claude rings once it has sat idle this long. The default is 60000, long enough
that you'd normally have gone back to look before it fires; `0` rings the moment a
turn ends.

#### Or ring it from a hook

A hook does the same job, and is the way to keep the bell while pointing
`preferredNotifChannel` at an OS-notification channel instead. In
`~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "printf '\\a' > /dev/tty 2>/dev/null || { [ -n \"$TMUX_PANE\" ] && printf '\\a' > \"$(tmux display-message -p -t \"$TMUX_PANE\" '#{pane_tty}' 2>/dev/null)\" 2>/dev/null; } || true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`Stop` fires the moment a turn ends, with no idle timer involved. The bell goes to
`/dev/tty` — the hook's controlling terminal, which inside tmux is the pane's own
pty, exactly where Claude's built-in bell would land. The `$TMUX_PANE` branch
covers a hook running without a controlling terminal, resolving the pane's tty
through tmux instead; the trailing `|| true` keeps a failed bell from failing the
hook.

Use the same command under `Notification` with the `permission_prompt` matcher to
ring when Claude asks for permission, or under `PreToolUse` matching
`AskUserQuestion` to ring when it asks you a question.

### Customizing the fzf picker

`@claude_fzf_options` is passed straight to `fzf`, so you can add your own bindings.

Here is a vim keybinding example:

```tmux
set -g @claude_fzf_options "\
  --prompt 'nav> ' \
  --bind 'j:down' \
  --bind 'k:up' \
  --bind 'q:abort' \
  --bind 'x:execute-silent(kill {3})+reload(sleep 0.3; \$CLAUDE_PICKER --list)' \
  --bind 'i:unbind(j,k,q,i,a,x)+change-prompt(filter> )' \
  --bind 'a:unbind(j,k,q,i,a,x)+change-prompt(filter> )' \
  --bind 'esc:rebind(j,k,q,i,a,x)+change-prompt(nav> )'"
```

The picker opens in **nav** mode:

| Key       | Action                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `j` / `k` | move down / up                                          |
| `i` / `a` | switch to **filter** mode — type to fuzzy-match         |
| `x`       | kill the highlighted agent (like the built-in `ctrl-x`) |
| `q`       | close the picker                                        |
| `enter`   | jump to the agent (both modes)                          |
| `esc`     | filter mode → back to nav                               |

Only the bound keys are special in nav mode; any other key still filters as you
type. `x` reloads the list through `$CLAUDE_PICKER`, a path the picker exports for
exactly this — write it as `\$CLAUDE_PICKER` inside the double-quoted value above
so tmux stores a literal `$` (in a single-quoted value, use a bare
`$CLAUDE_PICKER`).

## How it works

- The **launcher** creates a detached `claude-<hash-of-dir>` tmux session running
  `claude`, records the window it came from in `@claude_origin`, and attaches to
  it in a popup.
- **`claude agents --json`** is the source of truth for what is running and how it
  is doing. Each Claude session self-reports its state (`busy` / `waiting` /
  `idle`) to a supervisor daemon, which that command publishes. Nothing here scans
  processes for a `claude` command name — on macOS a pane reports its parent shell,
  never the `claude` child running inside it.
- **`agents.sh`** pairs each running Claude with the tmux pane it occupies by
  joining `pid` → `tty` → pane. That join is why identity is the Claude _process_
  rather than the tmux session, and therefore why several agents in one project
  each get their own row. It costs three subprocesses per render, whatever the
  number of sessions or panes.
- The **age column** is the mtime of the agent's transcript — its last sign of
  life. `claude agents --json` reports only `startedAt`, never a last-activity
  time. A brand-new agent that has yet to take a turn shows `-`.
- The **picker** renders those rows with a live `capture-pane` preview. On `enter`
  a **dedicated** agent (in a `claude-*` session) resumes in the popup over the
  window it was launched from, while a **loose** one (any other pane) is focused in
  place. `ctrl-x` kills the Claude process itself: a dedicated session dies with
  its last window, and a loose pane keeps the shell that hosted it.
- Pressing `prefix` + `u` **from inside a session popup** detaches that popup
  first (closing it), then reopens the picker full-size on the outer host client —
  so you never end up with a cramped popup-in-popup.
- **Bell forwarding**: a dedicated session is a separate tmux session, so a bell
  inside one is invisible to the window that launched it — tmux's own bell
  handling only looks within a single session's windows. A global `alert-bell`
  hook catches every bell server-wide, and for one from a `claude-*` session,
  `bell.sh` writes it into the origin window's own pane. tmux then treats it as
  if that pane rang the bell itself: the origin window gets the normal
  `window-status-bell-style` highlight, and if it's the window currently on
  screen (or `bell-action` is set to relay background bells), your terminal's
  own bell/tab indicator fires too. What rings in the first place is Claude
  Code's own notification config — see
  [Making Claude ring the bell](#making-claude-ring-the-bell). Set
  `@claude_forward_bell 'off'` to disable.

## OMP Hooks Integration

This plugin also works inside [Oh My Pi](https://github.com/) (omp) — the
coding-agent harness — via omp's extension/hook system. When omp runs inside
tmux, an omp **extension** wires the plugin's popups into omp's lifecycle so you
can manage Claude Code sessions without leaving omp.

### Install

Copy `omp-extension/` into your omp agent extensions directory:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.omp/agent/extensions
cp -r omp-extension ~/.omp/agent/extensions/claude-session-manager
```

Or point omp at this repo's `omp-extension` dir from `~/.omp/agent/config.yml`:

```yaml
extensions:
  - /path/to/tmux-claude-session-manager/omp-extension
```

Then restart omp (or load once with `omp --extension /path/to/omp-extension`).
If your layout puts the scripts somewhere else, set `CLAUDE_SESSION_MANAGER_DIR`
to the plugin repo root.

### What it does

On `session_start` (only when omp is inside tmux) it installs the plugin's
key bindings (`prefix` + `y`, `prefix` + `u`). It also adds two slash commands:

| Command         | Action                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/claude-list`  | Open the agent picker popup (same as `prefix` + `u`)         |
| `/claude-launch`| Launch or re-attach a Claude session for the current dir      |

Outside tmux the commands just print a notice — no error, no crash.

### "Don't kill yourself"

The integration is built so omp can never manage — detach or kill — its own
session. The omp extension records the pane omp actually runs in (read from
omp's own `$TMUX_PANE` at `session_start`) into the tmux global
`@claude_omp_pane`. The bash layer uses it in two places:

- `list.sh` refuses to detach any session that still contains that pane, so a
  `prefix`+`u` (or `/claude-list`) from omp's own session can never detach omp.
- `agents.sh` never lists that pane, so `ctrl-x` in the picker can never target
  the Claude hosting omp. It also skips the pane you opened the picker from
  (threaded into the popup as `OMP_HOST_PANE` via tmux `#{pane_id}` expansion).

Identity is carried by **tmux format expansion** (`#{pane_id}`), not by shell
env vars — `$TMUX_PANE` is empty inside `run-shell` and is the popup's pane
inside a popup, so relying on it would silently disable the guard. omp fires the
popups detached (`stdio: ignore`, unref'd), so its event loop never blocks on an
interactive fzf picker.
